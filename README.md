# Technologies & Technical Challenges

#### Backend: MongoDB/Express
The backend will be entirely platform agnostic with the exception of potential performance optimizations per platform. The separation of the back and front allows for either to be modified, built, updated, or swapped out entirely with minimal impact to the other.

#### Frontend: React/Node.js
The data will be visualized in a Web application using the D3 library. The visualization will take the form of linked circles. The Web app will also provide search capability

#### WebRTC/WebSocket api collection
Utilizing socket.io & peer.js libraries to create peer to peer connections through video chat and messaging. 

Our server will be listening for incoming connections and will establish a connection between clients through the WebSocket handshake when a request is made by a client.

We will be managing real-time display of changes by processing information from the upstream and downstream communications between our server and the clients.
